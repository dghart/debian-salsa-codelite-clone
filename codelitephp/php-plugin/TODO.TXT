Code Completion / Code Generation
=================================

- code completion: better comment for ctor/dtor functions
- code completion: add ctor function calltip... (its annoying!) NOTE: __constuct is not called by default. Only the child __construct should be called
- When typing inside 'require{_once}' auto complete file names
- code completion: add option to 'add include for ...'
- SFTP: add a per file destination folder to allow overriding the global settings
- Better parsing for functions' return value

Misc:
=====
- PHP indenter: 
    Keep array initialization 
    Break string concatenation

Usability:
==========
- Open resource dialog: by default, list there a list of recently opened files
- Function calltip should include the return value
- Allow user to define a deployment folder for his files 
  (in addition to the SFTP, it should also allow user to copy files by simply saving them)
- Add support for laravel wizard
- Fix nav bar for PHP plugin

NICE TO HAVE: 
- XDebug watches
