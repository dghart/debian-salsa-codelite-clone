CodeLite for Debian
-------------------
Debian's version of CodeLite is as close to upstreams version as possible, with
the following exceptions:
 * Lots of bundles libraries removed and replaced with versions packaged within
   Debian.
 * Various unnessesary and unsource binaries removed from the source archive.
 * Non free image (codelitephp/resources/php-folder-128.png) removed.

 * Uses the system default terminal emulator instead of directly opening xterm.
